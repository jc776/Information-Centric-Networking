Blackadder + NS3
    NS3 3.21 by itself builds and mostly works.
    	One test (out of 193) in "test.py" crashes, might be my hardware.
    
    (Need to confirm NS3 + Click)
    
	(Latest) Click + Blackadder + NS3 3.21 on Ubuntu 14.04 hasn't worked for me.
		Python import errors: Managed to fix some (modifying hidden files, etc)
		C++ compile errors, I don't know where to start.
	
	NS3 3.15 (the version Blackadder's "HowTo" uses) does not [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ns-3-users/Q0kic5TM8I0] work since Ubuntu 12.10.
	
Blackadder + OpenWRT
	I've installed OpenWRT (Barrier Breaker 14.07) on a router.
	Someone [https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages/blob/0fdc10b5ebb01de16ed0df04ee2f8ee406756f1e/click/Makefile] made a Click download-and-build package.
	I have the SDK working, and got made a working package from this.
	"test.click" works on the router.
	
	Adding Blackadder's HowTo instructions to this (to produce a "Click+Blackadder" package) hasn't worked for me.
		Creates 'ipkg-install/usr/...'
			bin/click, lib/libclick.a, usr/share/config.mk, etc.
		"make" on Blackadder:
			Accepts the location for "with-click=" so it looks like a valid Click install.
			Stops with C++ compile errors: "Undefined reference" to anything actually in Click.
			
Some things I could attempt from now:
- Downgrade Ubuntu to get the recommended NS3 to work, then start simulations in that
- From Blackadder's language libraries + examples, make PC's "Video Server", "Video Client"
- Attempt Android port (matches 'this week' in schedule)
