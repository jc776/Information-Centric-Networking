Main log - which areas I'm working on today, plus changes to Git structure
-----

Up to 14/11
[more to follow, copying from notebook]
Created Github repository. ('C++ ignores')
blackadder-on-pc: Started, up to 'installed Click on PC'.
openwrt-on-router: Started, did not get far.

24/11
Setting up RSA etc to identify working PC.
Cloned my repository, adding log so far.
Designing log files in more detail e.g. "a description of every file", "notes to self"
Copied out notebook logs in 'Up to 14/11'.

25/11
(blackadder-on-pc)
Got Blackadder & Click installed together.
Writing specific instructions/commands to install Blackadder 'with ns3, at user level'.
Got Click's output using Blackadder's 'sample.conf'.

26/11
(blackadder-on-pc)
Installing Blackadder 'C++ library' and 'other bindings'.

15/12
(openwrt-on-router)
Successfully flashed OpenWRT onto a router and connected to it.

16/12
(blackadder-on-router)
Looking into cross-compiling.
Attempting to send files from PC to router: sshfs, scp
sshfs requires a package on the router - may need to connect it to internet THROUGH home router.
^ This will be useful for installing 'click' anyway, unless I cross-compile click as well.

17/12
(packages-on-openwrt)
Following a guide to cross-compile 'Hello World' on the router. Baseline for the more complicated Blackadder makefile.
