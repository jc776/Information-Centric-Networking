Main log - which areas I'm working on today, plus changes to Git structure
-----

Up to 14/11
[more to follow, copying from notebook]
Created Github repository. ('C++ ignores')
blackadder-on-pc: Started, up to 'installed Click on PC'.
openwrt-on-router: Started, did not get far.

24/11
Setting up RSA etc to identify working PC.
Cloned my repository, adding log so far.
Designing log files in more detail e.g. "a description of every file", "notes to self"
Copied out notebook logs in 'Up to 14/11'.

25/11
(blackadder-on-pc)
Got Blackadder & Click installed together.
Writing specific instructions/commands to install Blackadder 'with ns3, at user level'.
Got Click's output using Blackadder's 'sample.conf'.

26/11
(blackadder-on-pc)
Installing Blackadder 'C++ library' and 'other bindings'.

15/12
(openwrt-on-router)
Successfully flashed OpenWRT onto a router and connected to it.

16/12
(blackadder-on-router)
Looking into cross-compiling.
Attempting to send files from PC to router: sshfs, scp
sshfs requires a package on the router - may need to connect it to internet THROUGH home router.
^ This will be useful for installing 'click' anyway, unless I cross-compile click as well.

17/12
(packages-on-openwrt)
Following a guide and listing a few misc. errors:
Successfully cross-compiled "Hello World" as "an OpenWRT ipk package"
Sent it to the router (scp worked this time), installed it on router, ran program
Able to remove package
This is a good baseline to have before trying to use Blackadder's more complicated build options.

18/12
(blackadder-on-router)

23/12
(blackadder-on-router)
Attempting cross-compiled "Click from local repository"
Compile errors for now

24/12
(blackadder-on-pc)
Installing language bindings to OS instead of to a local folder: Other make scripts use "-lblackadder" needing this default.
(blackadder-on-ns3)
Setting up NS3+Blackadder.
