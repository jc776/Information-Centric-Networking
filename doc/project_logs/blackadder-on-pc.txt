	* Following Blackadder's 'HowTo.pdf'.
	
	First attempt, "Quickstart"
		git clone https://github.com/kohler/click
		./configure --enable-nsclick --enable-blackadder (suggested)
			* Will be using ns3 bindings and blackadder.
			* "--enable-blackadder" is not recognised.
		./configure --enable-nsclick
			* '/boot/.../...-38-generic exists, but is unreadable'
			* Needs access to kernel/boot.
		sudo ./configure --enable-nsclick
			* Works OK.
		make (suggested)
			* Calls ./configure (weird Makefile structure), fails with 'unreadable' again.
		sudo make
			* Works OK, but I'd prefer a solution without sudo to follow guide better.
		sudo make install
			* This put a lot of files (not just executable) into /usr/local/bin.
			
		Install Blackadder's dependencies:
			sudo apt-get install ... (7 things)
				* libconfig++8 libconfig++8-dev gave message 'regex select libconfig8-dev'.
			* OK so far.
		
		Install Blackadder core:
			clone Blackadder repository
			blackadder/src:
			autoconf
			./configure
			make
				* Very slow. "make -j4" is parallel/faster and equivalent.
			sudo make install
				* Tons of 'sed' errors followed by 'no such file'.
			* Shutting down PC gave a "wrong MAC address" error, may be unrelated.
	* Sort of worked, but I don't like the number of commands that are sudo when the instructions aren't.
	
	Second attempt: "Installing Click" instructions
		* Disabling "kernel module" as it might reduce the number of sudo commands needed.
		sudo make uninstall
		* Later, I forgot to do this before deleting local repository... I'm not sure how to get all the bits of libraries out of the OS.
		
		./configure --disable-linuxmodule
			* Failed with 'permission denied'.
			* The sudo ./configure probably created files as root which I can't remove.
		
		* Deleted local repository.
		
		clone click repository
		./configure --disable-linuxmodule
		* These instructions omit 'make'.
		sudo make install
		
		clone blackadder repository
		
		mkdir click/elements/blackadder
		ln -s blackadder/src click/elements/blackadder
		(click) ./configure --enable-nsclick --enable-blackadder --disable-linuxmodule
			* --disable-blackadder isn't recognised.
		(click) ./configure --enable-nsclick --disable-linuxmodule
			* "blackadder" dir is errored.
			* Made some mistakes setting up symbolic links.
			
		(blackadder) autoconf
			* "autoconf: error: no input file"
		Instructions: ./configure -­‐with‐click=/path/to/binaries –prefix=/path/to/binaries
			* make creates the binaries in a directory userlevel/	
			* 'path to binaries': This is where 'install' will copy the binaries.
		(blackadder) ./configure --with-click=$HOME/...../builds/blackadder/ -prefix=$HOME/...../builds/blackadder/
			* "./configure: No such file or directory."
			* Probably because autoconf didn't work.
		
	Third attempt: "Installing Click" instructions
