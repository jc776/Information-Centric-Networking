Cross-compiling 'Hello World' as a package for the router.
-----

(Should separate links into general/router specific)
Mostly using this guide:
[1] https://giovanni.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/how-to-cross-compile-a-c-program-for-openwrt/
Minor reference, although article notes it may be wrong
[2] http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/packages

Misc (description where they're used)
[3] http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence
[4] http://blog.csdn.net/magicdog2009/article/details/41102811
[5] https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=50923

Differences between [1] and [2]:
[1] attempts to "download from PKG_SOURCE_URL and then compile"
[2] just compiles files on local PC.

Documenting any differences.
I'm using the name "hello_openwrt" instead of "helloworld"
Code is in hello_openwrt/
(Version in repository is after all instructions)

A simple program in C
---------------------
No problems doing this.

Setting up cross-compiler SDK
-----------------------------
SDK for this router: (WNDR3800)
http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-linux-x86_64-gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2.tar.bz2

Looks like "stable" link on: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk
"ar71xx" from "ar7161" on "Hardware Highlights", http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800

(Downloads/)
  Extract tar.bz2
  Copy hello_openwrt/ directory - structure:
  
    Downloads/
      OpenWRT-SDK-...tar.bz2
      OpenWRT-SDK-.../
        dl/
        docs/
        ...
        Makefile                  <-- Came with SDK (Do setup work, then build everything in package/)
        package/
          Makefile                <-- Came with SDK (executed by top-level one)
          hello_openwrt/
            Makefile              <-- Created in second step - # OpenWrt Makefile for hello_openwrt program
            src/
              Makefile            <-- Created in first step  - # build hello_openwrt executable when user executes "make"
              hello_openwrt.c
  
  *** DIFFERENT TO GUIDE:
    Alternatively, create symlink instead of copying.
    ln -s $HOME/.../Information-Centric-Networking/hello_openwrt $HOME/.../Downloads/OpenWrt-SDK-.../package/hello_openwrt

Create "second step" Makefile.
------------------------------
*** DIFFERENT TO GUIDE
  DESCRIPTION section modified as noted at END of guide [1] and first code example of [2]
  
Run SDK root's Makefile
-----------------------
 *** NOT LISTED IN GUIDE
  When I did this:
    Build dependency: Please install ncurses. (Missing libncurses.so or ncurses.h)
    Build dependency: Please install GNU awk.
    Build dependency: Please install the subversion client.
    
    "2: exec: ccache: not found" into "make: *** [world] Error 2"
    
  May differ for other SDKs (different router or different OpenWRT versions)
  sudo apt-get install
    ncurses-dev or libncurses5-dev
    gawk ("GNU awk" - Ubuntu default as of now is "mawk")
    subversion
    ccache
  
  [3] - 'official' list of dependencies
  [4] - 'ccache is just a program to install' - ccache isn't listed in [3].

(Downloads/OpenWRT-SDK-.../)
  make V=99
    
  SOME POSSIBLE ERRORS:
  - I had the directory named "hello_openwrt" but still had references to guide's "helloworld", hence file not found.
  - Many other possible sources of similar-looking errors - guide's warning "tabs vs spaces", "remove spaces at the end of lines/variable defns
  
  - "Signing key has not been configured" [5] - "Not an error in this case", or "Create a key" (I didn't have to)
  
File Downloads/OpenWRT-SDK-.../bin/ar71xx/packages/base/hello_openwrt_1_ar71xx.ipk
                                     ^ router-specific.
Differs per router model/OpenWRT version - [1] had it in SDK/bin/packages/.

Packages is a summary of built packages.
Packages.gz is the same file, compressed.

Send this package to the router
-------------------------------
As noted at the END of the guide, use "opkg" instead of "ipkg".
Otherwise guide's instructions work the same:

(folder containing ipk)
  scp hello_openwrt_1_ar71xx.ipk root@192.168.1.1:
  
(Router's home directory)
  root@OpenWrt:~# ls
  hello_openwrt_1_ar71xx.ipk  transfer_test
  root@OpenWrt:~# opkg install hello_openwrt_1_ar71xx.ipk 
  Installing hello_openwrt (1) to root...
  Configuring hello_openwrt.
  root@OpenWrt:~# hello_openwrt
  Hello, OpenWRT package manager!

To remove a package:
  root@OpenWrt:~# opkg remove hello_openwrt
  Removing package hello_openwrt from root...
  root@OpenWrt:~# hello_openwrt
  -ash: hello_openwrt: not found
