Cross-compiling 'Hello World' as a package for the router.
-----

Mostly using this guide:
[1] https://giovanni.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/how-to-cross-compile-a-c-program-for-openwrt/

Documenting any differences.
Code is in hello_openwrt_package/
(Version in repository is after all instructions)

"A simple program in C" - OK

SDK for this router: (WNDR3800)
http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/OpenWrt-SDK-ar71xx-for-linux-x86_64-gcc-4.8-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2.tar.bz2

  - Looks like "stable" link on: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/obtain.firmware.sdk
  - "ar71xx" from "ar7161" on "Hardware Highlights", http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/netgear/wndr3800
  
  (Downloads/)
    Extract tar.bz2
    Copy (or symlink) hello_openwrt_package/ directory - structure:

          Makefile                  <-- Came with SDK

              Makefile              <-- Created in second step - # OpenWrt Makefile for helloworld program
              src/
                Makefile            <-- Created in first step  - # build helloworld executable when user executes "make"
                helloworld.c
