Notes to self - plans/ideas for next time and future
-----

All the time:
	Update the 'description, file structure' logs when adding the content instead of a later time.



Next time I work:
	Add new files to dirs. Move ba 5 line test to gen_logs.
	

Soon:
	Set up backing up to MCS. ("Set up SSH, then use to clone every so often", or something automatic)
	If I keep up 'log per section' ("OpenWRT on router" separate to "BA port to router", etc), each one will only be a couple days long. Rethink structure.
	Not yet tested:                                     Will do at stage:
		Installing NS3, so Click NS3 support            Creating NS3 components ('are Click components there')
		In NS3: Blackadder 'example' components         Creating NS3 components ('are Blackadder components there')
		Java binding                                    Blackadder on Android and/or Blackadder Java Applications
		Python binding                                  If useful for NS3
		C binding                                       If useful for applications
	Instructions for "Building programs with ___"       When I make or run C++, Java, C? examples.


Research/Far future:
	All logs into some 'organizer' program eg 'lines of text per date, coloured/hidden per log'.



Completed ideas:
	24/11
		Starting this 'notes to self' log - anything "for the next time I work", or "it'd be nice to do this"
	
	25/11
		Added file structure description to top of files
	
	26/11
