Notes to self - plans/ideas for next time and future
-----

All the time:
Update the 'description, file structure' logs when adding the content instead of a later time.

Soon:
Set up backing up to MCS. ("Set up SSH, then use to clone every so often", or something automatic)
If I keep up 'log per section' ("OpenWRT on router" separate to "BA port to router", etc), each one will only be a couple days long. Rethink structure.

24/11
Starting this 'notes to self' log - anything "for the next time I work", or "it'd be nice to do this"
Add/keep file structure description to top of files

Next time I work:

Research/Far future:
All logs into some 'organizer' program eg 'lines of text per date, coloured/hidden per log'.
