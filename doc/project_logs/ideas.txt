Notes to self - plans/ideas for next time and future
-----

All the time:
	Update the 'description, file structure' logs when adding the content instead of a later time.



Next time I work:
	Add new files to dirs. Move ba 5 line test to gen_logs.
	

New useful work I'll have:
	Finished simulations should be self-contained i.e. no "mod cfg, deploy, add includes"
	Finished demo should be self-contained (./deploy on one PC, run publisher on server, subscriber on client. Anything to start up TM? (on server, or router)


Soon:
	If I keep up 'log per section' ("OpenWRT on router" separate to "BA port to router", etc), each one will only be a couple days long. Rethink structure.
	Not yet tested:                                     Will do at stage:
		Java binding                                    Blackadder on Android and/or Blackadder Java Applications
		Python binding                                  If useful for NS3
	Instructions for "Building programs with ___"       When I make or run C++, Java, C? examples.


Research/Far future:
	All logs into some 'organizer' program eg 'lines of text per date, coloured/hidden per log'.



Completed ideas:
	24/11
		Starting this 'notes to self' log - anything "for the next time I work", or "it'd be nice to do this"
	
	25/11
		Added file structure description to top of files
	
	26/01
		Installing NS3, so Click NS3 support
		In NS3: Blackadder 'example' components (can deploy Blackadder's ns3-sample)
		C binding (used for some examples)
	27/01
		Backed up to the MCS.
