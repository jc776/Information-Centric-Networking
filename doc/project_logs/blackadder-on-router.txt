"the kernel version of the Blackadder implementation"
- What I've done so far for PC is the user-level version.

"i) Compile and strip Click for the selected target
ii) Compile and strip the kernel version of Blackadder for the selected target
iii) Enable required support so that the deployment script configures OpenWRT
nodes."

"and strip" - "remove statically linked but unusable bloat"

^ mentions that an OpenWRT port (having achieved those steps) does exist, but doesn't say where to find it.
  
1. Sending files to router
  [1] http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/106480/how-to-copy-files-from-one-machine-to-another-using-ssh
  [2] https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS
  
  Installation:
    sudo apt-get install sshfs
  
    "Add yourself to 'fuse' group" [2] - I used terminal method
  
  Test sending a file:
    Create working folders:
    (PC)
      $HOME/.../transfer_mount
    
    (Router)
      ~: root's home directory. Others might work if user accounts are set up.
      ~/transfer_test
      ~/transfer_test/existing
    
    (PC, transfer/)
      sshfs -o idmap=user root@192.168.1.1:/transfer_test $HOME/.../transfer_mount
      * "Mount transfer_test on router to transfer_mount on PC.
      * -o idmap: "files owned by the remote host (root@192) will appear on PC as owned by PC"
      
  
  
TEST
jack@galillean:~/Desktop/Project/transfer$ scp -r ~/Desktop/Project/transfer/testsend root@192.168.1.1:/transfer_test
root@192.168.1.1's password: 
file                                          100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00

root@OpenWrt:~/transfer_test# ls
existing

^ Expected directory "testsend" to be on router...
