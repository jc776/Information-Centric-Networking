install-pc-blackadder-and-ns3 needed first.


sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk ("sun-java6-jdk" is also possible)

sudo apt-get install ant swig
	* ant: Build system
	* swig: Language bindings generator.

Install Blackadder C++ Library & SWIG Bindings

	($PROJ/repos/blackadder/lib)
	* Note "/lib".
	
	autoreconf -fi
		* "regenerate configure and Makefile"
		* Options from guide:
		* force: "remake all files, not just old ones" - Since this might be a different platform to the one they generated files on.
		* install: "copy missing auxilliary files"
	
		* I got many warnings about "subdir-objects is disabled", "this option will be true in future automake versions"
		* Not sure which behaviour is intended.
		
	./configure --enable-python --enable-c
		* C:      "C Samples"
		* Python: I think NS3 accepts Python scripts, may be useful.
		* Java:   Using "alternative to SWIG bindings" instead.
		* Ruby is also available.
		
		* Check HowTo for specifics on "Multiple versions of Python 2.x"
		
		* Specifically not using --prefix option:
		* Other make scripts refer to "-lblackadder" which uses default directory.
		* They could be modified to look in different locations
		
		* Will look into "set CLASSPATH..." "set PYTHONPATH..." when making scripts using these.
	
	make
	sudo make install
		* 'sudo' since we're installing to OS.

Installing Blackadder JAVA Library
	* As in HowTo.
	* My location for jni.h was different to default:
	/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include/
	
	Files generated:
	$PROJ/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding/jni/eu_pursuit_client_BlackadderWrapper.so
	$PROJ/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding/dist/blackadder-java-binding.jar
	
	* Will look into importing when making scripts using these.

Installing Topology Manager
	* This is the source of "topology.graphml" that ns3 examples were looking for.
	* As in HowTo.
	
	(dependencies already installed earlier)
	($PROJ/repos/blackadder/TopologyManager)
		make
			* Worked.
		
		./tm topology.graphml
			* Encountered some problems here, see end for attempts to fix.
		
			* "Blackadder Library: Could not send SUBSCRIBE_SCOPE request: Operation not permitted"
		sudo ./tm topology.graphml
			* "Blackadder Library: Could not send SUBSCRIBE_SCOPE request: Connection refused"

		Joining the "dialout" group didn't work.
		
		"sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward"
	
Deployment Tools
	($PROJ/repos/blackadder/deployment)
		make
			* Worked, generated "deploy" executable.


-------------------------------------------

Problems found:
	swig: command not found
	Dependencies.

./tm topology.graphml
	* "Blackadder Library: Could not send SUBSCRIBE_SCOPE request: Operation not permitted"
sudo ./tm topology.graphml
	* "Blackadder Library: Could not send SUBSCRIBE_SCOPE request: Connection refused"

These are OS ("perror") messages - from source, "sendmsg" function is failing.

Joining the "dialout" group didn't work.

	"net.ipv4.ip_forward"
	* Didn't work.
