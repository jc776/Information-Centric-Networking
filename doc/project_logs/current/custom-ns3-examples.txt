I'm attempting to make the NS3 simulations self contained instead of needing 'deployed'.
I'll need to work out how to have a subscriber move between nodes (i.e. continue where it left off) etc to do project's scenarios.
I'll also be modifying them to output graphs etc. of network characteristics


Log

Copying blackadder-examples to blackadder-jc776
Linking in ns3/examples directory.

I'm creating a "cfg" by modifying "ns3_topology1.cfg", deploying it, then copying generated files to "originals" and "conf"
eg.

./deploy -c $PROJ/repos/Information-Centric-Networking/ns3_scripts/blackadder-jc776/deploy_originals/cfg/2nodes.cfg -s
in /tmp/:
00000001.conf
00000002.conf
topology.graphml
topology.cpp     -> 2nodes.cpp
Moving to my folder structure and changing hard-coded paths to "source file's directory/..."
Modifying wcript for new directory structure
