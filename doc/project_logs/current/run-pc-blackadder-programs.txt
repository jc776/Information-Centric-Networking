Getting 'example' programs running.
-----

install-pc-blackadder-and-ns3 and install-pc-blackadder-lib-and-programs needed first.

sudo apt-get install vlc

Currently everything needs "sudo". Will work on this later.


1. Install some example programs:

(blackadder/examples/samples)
	make
	"publisher" and "subscriber" work.

(blackadder/examples/video_streaming)
	make
	Haven't been able to run these yet. (blackadder can't communicate without root, VLC refuses to run with root)

(blackadder/examples/video_streaming/VideoDemoApp)
	sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
	
	For the following paths, $PROJ won't work as a shortcut.
	
	Paths on my system:
		/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/include/jni.h
		/home/jack/Desktop/Project/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding/jni/eu_pursuit_client_BlackadderWrapper.so
		/home/jack/Desktop/Project/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding/dist/blackadder-java-binding.jar
	
	Build 'Native' (Not SWIG) Java Binding from "install-pc-blackadder-and-programs"
	then:
	
	Modify the two paths in VideoDemoApp/project.properties to match your "BlackadderWrapper.so":
		BAWrapperPath=/home/jack/Desktop/Project/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding/jni/eu_pursuit_client_BlackadderWrapper.so
		DefaultMovieFolder=/home/jack/Videos

	Modify line 4 of build.xml to match your username/Blackadder location e.g
		<property name="BlackadderJava.location" value="/home/jack/Desktop/Project/repos/blackadder/lib/bindings/java-binding"/>
	
	For some reason the default instructions as for "commons-codec-1.5", when we already got "1.4" for Native Java Lib.
	Modify line 10 of build.xml:
		<pathelement location="${BlackadderJava.location}/lib/commons-codec-1.4.jar"/>
	Delete line 16 of build.xml (for some reason the same jar would need to be in two places?)
		<pathelement location="lib/commons-codec-1.5.jar"/>
	
	Open VideoDemoApp/lib/BuildLib.txt, download the listed files into that folder.
		Codec had a broken link. Attempting to use "1.4" which we got with Native Java Binding.
		 try eg http://archive.apache.org/
	
	Attempting to use codec 1.4: Sound works, picture does not.
	
	sudo ant g_publisher
	sudo ant subscriber
	
	






2. 'Deploy' a 'single node' config, start "Click + Blackadder"

(This is probably awful security.)
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Make a key, add self to ssh e.g. http://superuser.com/questions/336226/how-to-ssh-to-localhost-without-password

($PROJ/repos/Information-Centric-Networking/blackadder_applications/deploy_sudo)
ALTERNATE: ($PROJ/repos/blackadder/deployment)

Copy single_node.cfg to single_node_mod.cfg
"
BLACKADDER_ID_LENGTH = 8;
LIPSIN_ID_LENGTH = 32;
CLICK_HOME = "/usr/local/";			<-- Click "prefix", if changed. (Leave as this if unchanged)
WRITE_CONF = "/tmp/";
USER = "jack";					<-- Your username.
SUDO = true;                                    <-- 'true' necessary on Ubuntu.
OVERLAY_MODE = "mac";

network = {
    nodes = (
    {
        testbed_ip = "127.0.0.1";		<-- Or "localhost" or internal ip e.g. 192.---, 172.---, 10.---
        running_mode = "user";
        label = "00000001";
        role = ["RV","TM"];
    });
};
"



./deploy -c (...)/single_node_mod.cfg
ALTERNATE:
	"Restart Click if needed"
	SUDO=true:  The "sudo /.../click" command actually failed since it was in the background.
	SUDO=false: On Ubuntu 12.04, this version of click can't actually communicate with other processes.
	so
		sudo pkill -9 click
		(+ alt. command for kernel mode click)
		sudo click /tmp/00000001.conf
		... You have to do this on all network devices.
	The modified version runs "sudo click in the background" in the background correctly.

(Terminal 1 - /blackadder/TopologyManager)
sudo ./tm /tmp/topology.graphml

(Terminal 2 - /blackadder/examples/samples)
sudo ./publisher

(Terminal 3 - /blackadder/examples/samples)
sudo ./subscriber

Lots of output on "PUBLISH_SCOPE", etc:
	Working as intended.

After running subscriber, still no output except "Process ID:" on all:
	Click isn't running, or wasn't restarted from 'ALTERNATE:' deploy.






Other notes
---------------------------------
	





"Advertise the catalog by pressing . and enter" - oh.

LocalRV: added subscriber 00000001 to (new) scope /FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFB (2)					(TM)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) scope: /0000000000000000(2)					(Publisher startup)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) InformationItem: /0000000000000000/7CF130A877261C4C(2)	(Publisher video #1)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) InformationItem: /0000000000000000/0000000000000000(2)	(Publisher catalog)
LocalRV: added subscriber 00000001 to information item /0000000000000000/0000000000000000(2)		(Subscriber looking for catalog)
... nothing?



----
I can get the programs to build and run
For some reason every BA program needs "sudo" or I get "operation not permitted"
"video subscriber" never recieves the list, even if I have TM etc running.
----



./deploy -c single_node_mod.cfg

"restart Click if needed" - I think deploy did this for me

Unsure. I can't run click [new conf] any more.


($PROJ/repos/blackadder/video_streaming)
	Create folder "videos"
	Put some video files in it.
	(will put some in repo to symlink in)
	
	make


#(Terminal 1: 
#	sudo click $PROJ/repos/blackadder/src/sample.conf
	
(Terminal 2 - /blackadder/TopologyManager)
	sudo ./tm /tmp/topology.graphml
	
(Terminal 3 - /blackadder/examples/video_streaming)
	sudo ./video_publisher
	
	Type "gizmo.mp4"
	
(Terminal 4 - /blackadder/examples/video_streaming)
	sudo ./video_subscriber


Attempting to run Blackadder programs:
"1 FN, 1 RV?, 1 publisher, 1 subscriber on local PC"
"2 FNs as virtual machines?, 1 RV?, 1 publisher, 1 subscriber on local PC"


-----
Problems encountered

Deploy "connection refused"
Install ssh. For some reason it connects to self.

Running "click sample.conf" fails after "eth0: socket: Operation not permitted".
Topology Manager and examples failing with "Blackadder Library: Could not send ... request: Operation not permitted"
sudo (above) failing with "Blackadder Library: Could not send ... request: Connection refused"

- Have "sudo click $PROJ/repos/blackadder/src/sample.conf" running first.
- Run each program with "sudo". (I'd prefer not to, will work on this later)


video subscriber:
"subscribing to the video catalogue information item"
Then no response.
Need to do the whole "single_node_mod", "deploy", "run click and TM"
