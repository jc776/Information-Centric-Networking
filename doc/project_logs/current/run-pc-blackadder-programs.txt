Getting 'example' programs running.
-----

install-pc-blackadder-and-ns3 and install-pc-blackadder-lib-and-programs needed first.

sudo apt-get install vlc

Currently everything needs "sudo". Will work on this later.



1. 'Deploy' a 'single node' config, start "Click + Blackadder"

(This is probably awful security.)
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Make a key, add self to ssh e.g. http://superuser.com/questions/336226/how-to-ssh-to-localhost-without-password

($PROJ/repos/blackadder/TopologyManager)
Copy single_node.cfg to single_node_mod.cfg
"
BLACKADDER_ID_LENGTH = 8;
LIPSIN_ID_LENGTH = 32;
CLICK_HOME = "/usr/local/";			<-- Click "prefix", if changed. (Leave as this if unchanged)
WRITE_CONF = "/tmp/";
USER = "jack";					<-- Your username.
SUDO = true;
OVERLAY_MODE = "mac";

network = {
    nodes = (
    {
        testbed_ip = "127.0.0.1";		<-- Or "localhost" or internal ip e.g. 192.---, 172.---, 10.---
        running_mode = "user";
        label = "00000001";
        role = ["RV","TM"];
    });
};
"






"Advertise the catalog by pressing . and enter" - oh.

LocalRV: added subscriber 00000001 to (new) scope /FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFB (2)					(TM)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) scope: /0000000000000000(2)					(Publisher startup)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) InformationItem: /0000000000000000/7CF130A877261C4C(2)	(Publisher video #1)
LocalRV: added publisher 00000001 to (new) InformationItem: /0000000000000000/0000000000000000(2)	(Publisher catalog)
LocalRV: added subscriber 00000001 to information item /0000000000000000/0000000000000000(2)		(Subscriber looking for catalog)
... nothing?



----
I can get the programs to build and run
For some reason every BA program needs "sudo" or I get "operation not permitted"
"video subscriber" never recieves the list, even if I have TM etc running.
----



./deploy -c single_node_mod.cfg

"restart Click if needed" - I think deploy did this for me

Unsure. I can't run click [new conf] any more.


($PROJ/repos/blackadder/video_streaming)
	Create folder "videos"
	Put some video files in it.
	(will put some in repo to symlink in)
	
	make


#(Terminal 1: 
#	sudo click $PROJ/repos/blackadder/src/sample.conf
	
(Terminal 2 - /blackadder/TopologyManager)
	sudo ./tm /tmp/topology.graphml
	
(Terminal 3 - /blackadder/examples/video_streaming)
	sudo ./video_publisher
	
	Type "gizmo.mp4"
	
(Terminal 4 - /blackadder/examples/video_streaming)
	sudo ./video_subscriber


Attempting to run Blackadder programs:
"1 FN, 1 RV?, 1 publisher, 1 subscriber on local PC"
"2 FNs as virtual machines?, 1 RV?, 1 publisher, 1 subscriber on local PC"

Problems encountered

Deploy "connection refused"
Install ssh. For some reason it connects to self.

Running "click sample.conf" fails after "eth0: socket: Operation not permitted".
Topology Manager and examples failing with "Blackadder Library: Could not send ... request: Operation not permitted"
sudo (above) failing with "Blackadder Library: Could not send ... request: Connection refused"

- Have "sudo click $PROJ/repos/blackadder/src/sample.conf" running first.
- Run each program with "sudo". (I'd prefer not to, will work on this later)


video subscriber:
"subscribing to the video catalogue information item"
Then no response.
Need to do the whole "single_node_mod", "deploy", "run click and TM"
