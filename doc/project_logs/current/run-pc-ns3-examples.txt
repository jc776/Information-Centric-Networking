I made a more comprehensive change that makes the examples more self-contained, so end users don't have to run the deployment tool (Still needs 'ns3+Blackadder' working)

In ns3-3.15/examples, make a link to I-C-N/ns3_scripts/blackadder-jc776 folder in the same way as the existing "blackadder-examples".
export NS_LOG=Publisher=level_info:Subscriber=level_info
./waf --run ns3_topology1
should work without running the deployment tool.


Details of the 'file path' changes are in I-C-N/ns3_scripts/blackadder-jc776/ns3_topology1_selfcontained.cpp.
The deploy-generated files are copied into the folder structure there instead of /tmp/.

Original version:
-----

Attempting to run ns3 examples by themselves fails requiring specific files from user "pursuit".
It turns out these files & a CPP file for your username/etc can be created by the "deploy" tool.

(Following HowTo's "Running an NS3 simulation"
($PROJ/repos/blackadder/deployment)
	./deploy -c $PROJ/repos/blackadder/ns3/blackadder-model/model/ns3_topology1.cfg -s

	cp /tmp/topology.cpp $PROJ/repos/ns-allinone-3.15/ns-3.15/examples/blackadder/example3.cc
	
($PROJ/repos/ns-allinone-3.15/ns-3.15/examples/blackadder-examples)
	Modify example3.cc
	Add to the top of the file:
"
#include "publisher.h"
#include "subscriber.h"
"

Modify wscript
	Copy example2 section
	If inserting newlines, match the indenting. (Required by Python)
"
    
    obj = bld.create_ns3_program('example3', ['core', 'point-to-point', 'blackadder', 'applications'])
    obj.source = ['example3.cc', 'publisher.cc','subscriber.cc',]
"

($PROJ/repos/ns-allinone-3.15/ns-3.15/)
	./waf build
	./waf --run examples/blackadder-examples/example3
	
	Appears to work.

Errors found:

When making simulations for real, it looks like separate .cfg files are needed for real deploy vs simulated deploy.
ns3's has a lot of extra options for "delay of this connection", etc.
Might also specify some simple tests to automate (checking)

"expected )":
	Comes from deploying a non-ns3 cfg file.
	single_node generates a line 'fw::Forwarder(globalconf,0,' with no ending bracket.
	ns3_topology1.cfg ends the network object with an extra ");".
