Quality Of Service Simulation

Layout
------
	Main:
		One Server (Publisher, FN, TM, RV)
		One Router (FN)
		Two Clients (Subscriber, FN or part of router's FN? Need to check distinction for Mobility.)
	
	Secondary:
		One Server
		One Router
		One Client
	
	TCP
		(Completely different code, same data file and wires I guess)
		One Server
		One Router
		Two Clients

Experiment
----------
	The server is publishing a video. (Fixed, v. large file OR rapidly changing chunks on a single ID)
	The clients subscribe to the video.
	Through the protocol (I think?) the router is *passively/internally* a subscriber (Mobility: 'second' router is *actively* a subscriber)

	Monitor the traffic on the line between server and router.
	- 1x traffic in secondary case
	- 1-1.1x traffic in primary case - the server only needs to send the video data over the network as a single connection (Either "once", for large file, or still repeatedly for chunks)
	- 2x traffic in the TCP case - there are two connections each sending video data from the server towards a client
	
Existing
----
Auto-generated "deploy_originals"
- create 'devices', create 'click'/'tm' running on particular nodes
- create 'applications' using imported classes, that run on particular nodes for a fixed length of time

publisher.h (Imported class)
	(publisher.h says:)
	* 'A sample publisher application.'
	* When the publisher is started, it advertises root scope 00000000000 and schedules (at 0 seconds) an NS3 event. 
	* Each time this event is scheduled, the publisher will advertise a randomly generated information identifier.
	
subscriber.h (Imported class)
- Subscribes to scope 00000000000
- Logs anything it recieves.
- (Paired up with publisher, it should receive something every half second)

New Work
--------

ns3_video_publisher_app.cc
- The "video_publisher" example started a CVLC stream
- Asks for 1500 bytes at a time - this is either "whenever the stream makes this much" (slow) or "more than is available, so as much as possible"

"Recommended Encoder Settings"
"720p"
1280x720
Video Bitrates
    Maximum 4000 Kbps
    Recommended 2500 Kbps
    Minimum 1500 Kbps

These are the rates I'll set the publisher to make data at.
May need to test or measure "how fast it generates them", but the data rate is all that should matter.

1500b per packet
2500000b per second

3/5000 seconds per packet
... ah.





Generating and Modifying
------------------------
Network layout - one of 'deploy_originals/cfg'

(repos) ./blackadder/deployment/deploy -c ./Information-Centric-Networking/ns3_scripts/blackadder-jc776/deploy_originals/cfg/QoS_single_client.cfg -s
