(Will need to copy up 'how I made these' from failed/...)

I'm attempting to make these a normal 'package' through the SDK instead of cross-compiling the entire OS.

Install OpenWRT SDK
(... picking for specific router, etc)

Link packages in I-C-N/openwrt_packages to sdk/package/
(ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS - "link Blackadder in /src", etc)

New dependencies -
GNU awk (apt: "gawk")
SVN (apt: "subversion")


click:
	make[4]: *** No rule to make target `elementmap.xml'.  Stop.
	(this is an old one, will remove.)
