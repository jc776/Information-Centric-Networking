(Will need to copy up 'how I made these' from failed/...)

I'm attempting to make these a normal 'package' through the SDK instead of cross-compiling the entire OS.

Install OpenWRT SDK
(... picking for specific router, etc)

Link packages in I-C-N/openwrt_packages to sdk/package/
(ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS - "link Blackadder in /src", etc)

New dependencies -
GNU awk (apt: "gawk")
SVN (apt: "subversion")
ccache (apt: "ccache")  ("C compiler cannot make executables")


hello_openwrt worked.
click worked.

Changed click+blackadder to clone blackadder as well.

Learning 'quilt patch' to make click+blackadder 'drop in packages/, run make'. (instead of "link the source here & edit these configs, then run make")
28/1: didn't do "patch configure" method, did "ln -s blackadder click/elements/"

"undefined ref to everything" as before in blackadder.
28/1: fixed, maybe.

The CPP files cross-compiled, but "requirement blackadder not available" when ran on router.
