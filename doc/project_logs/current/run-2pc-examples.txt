12 PC:
($PROJ/repos/)
./Information-Centric-Networking/blackadder_applications/deploy_sudo/deploy -c ./Information-Centric-Networking/deploy_scripts/2nodes_assigned.cfg




sudo ./blackadder/TopologyManager/tm /tmp/topology.graphml



14 PC:
(Blackadder installed slightly different on here, so I needed to restart the programs)

($PROJ)
sudo ./builds/click/bin/click /tmp/00000002.conf

sudo ./repos/blackadder/examples/samples/publisher
Outputs lots of "START_PUBLISH"


12 PC:
($PROJ/repos/)
sudo ./blackadder/examples/samples/subscriber
Outputs lots of "SCOPE_PUBLISHED", "PUBLISHED_DATA"



2 NODE CONNECTION IS WORKING

To make things smoother:
- Fix Blackadder install on 14 PC. (Only Blackadder, no attempt at NS3 or cross-compile)
- Fix (cfg or code) for 'auto assign connections'.
- Re-add/uncomment deploy's 'auto start TM'

Deploy "-a" option isn't working for MAC mode either modified deploy or original
"0 nodes"
segfault 
- Specifying connections and roles.
- Below changing overlay mode fixed this.


Response on 14 PC's click to publisher starting
No response on 12 PC's tm (or restarted click)
"source MAC: 00-00-00-00-00-00"
- was running in MAC mode but unable to get addresses for some reason.
- changed overlay mode to IP for now
