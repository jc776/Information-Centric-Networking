Installing VideoDemoApp on Ubuntu 14.04
-------------------------------------

As of 2015, the VLC version used by Blackadder's VideoDemoApp no longer exists officially or in VideoLAN PPAs for Ubuntu 14.04 or 12.04.

I've updated it to work on Ubuntu 14.04.

Prerequisites:
	Blackadder
	(C Library, Topology Manager)
	Blackadder's Native Java Library
	
	VLC 2.1.6 from default Ubuntu package manager
	VLC 2.2+ should work as well, unsure about 3.
	Ubuntu Restricted Extras for e.g. H264 plugin.
	libvlc-dev
	
	Any other prerequisites for VLCj I've missed:

(Information-Centric-Networking/blackadder_applications/caching_video_apps/VideoDemoVLC2/lib)
	wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/commons/codec/binaries/commons-codec-1.5-bin.zip
	Extract "commons-codec-1.5.jar" from this.
	(I'm not sure why it's needed here as well as in Native Java Library. There's two separate references in build.xml)
	
	Download vlc-3.6.0-dist.zip:
		(http://capricasoftware.co.uk/#/projects/vlcj/tutorial/installation)
		http://capricasoftware.co.uk/downloads/vlcj/vlcj-3.6.0-dist.zip
	
	Extract four jar files:
		vlcj-3.6.0.jar (This is different to -dist)
		jna-3.5.2.jar
		platform-3.5.2.jar
		slf4j-api-1.7.10.jar
   
(Information-Centric-Networking/blackadder_applications/caching_video_apps/VideoDemoVLC2/)
	gedit project.properties
	Modify the first path to "so path" from Native Java Library.
	(Optionally modify video path)
	
	Modify line 4 of build.xml to "binding location" from Native Java Library.
