THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL OPENWRT OR CLICK PACKAGE

IF DEPLOYING BLACKADDER ON A ROUTER, CROSS-COMPILE/INSTALL THIS PACKAGE (NOT "click")

This is an OpenWRT package to cross-compile both Click and Blackadder.

The official one downloads a fresh copy, which wouldn't work with the changes needed to add Blackadder.
(Additionally, the 'source URL' in this no longer exists)
OFFICIAL PACKAGE (Old and broken): https://github.com/openwrt-es/barrier-breaker-openwrt-packages/blob/master/net/click/Makefile

See blackadder-on-pc (Dependencies for Blackadder & Click)
See packages-on-openwrt (SDK setup)
See blackadder-on-router (Documents creating this)
