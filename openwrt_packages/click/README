IF INSTALLING BLACKADDER ON A ROUTER, ONLY CROSS-COMPILE/SEND "click_blackadder", NOT THIS

This is an OpenWRT package to cross-compile Click from a local clone.
It's a test run before adding Blackadder as well.

The official one downloads a fresh copy, which wouldn't work with the changes needed to add Blackadder.
(Additionally, the repository mentioned no longer exists)
