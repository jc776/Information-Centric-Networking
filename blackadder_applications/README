VideoDemoVLC2 is the same VideoDemo as Blackadder, but updated for VLC 2 and a
more recent VLCj version.

VideoCaching sets up a cache node (as well as server, client) and does transfer 
data, but did not work in practice.

deploy_sudo is the Deployment tool modified to use a different Bash command, 
which has you enter the password for each command over SSH. 
Blackadder's instructions instead add users to an 'no-password sudo' group.
Without either of these, it stalls at a password prompt that isn't shown over 
SSH.
